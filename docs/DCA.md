# on-chain DCA on any DEX

New Utilities for NFT holders and deflationary tokenomics for the AQUA token

- Cost 1 AQUA to submit orders through DCA protocol.
- - 100% of the collected AQUA is burned.
- - Functionality is `public` to burn.
- [Gold NFT](https://aquas.trade/nft) Holders are granted free access to use DCA functionality on any DEX protocol.

## Fee

- 1 AQUA token
- - approval is required before submitting DCA order
