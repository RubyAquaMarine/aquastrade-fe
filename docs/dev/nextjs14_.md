Now, you have to specify where components should execute, which ones are Client Components, which ones are server, and how they work together

# SSR : Server side components

Pros:

- state less frequently , useState less often
- redefines the development experience
- page prerendered and ready for using (wouldn't work for charting, live data)

# Client-Side Rendering (CSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG).

- fetch from server or api after initial load(in browser: slow for user)
- - handle state and rendering and when to fetch data asynchronously. (more work:logic))
