# How to design the nft holder database and airdrop aqua

/src/app/api/route.ts

- a button on the airdrop page that fetches the data from the api
- need a snap shot of all nft holders in 3 files : POST [{},{},{}] to api : then fetch list into airdrop ui
- - [input collection size ] /[ aqua amount]= [ airdrop per nft] :: fetch nft owners db
- - for $aqua quarterly airdrops in 3 clicks. (make is public then anyone can airdrop: to Aqua nft holders too)
