- btc halving

- .babelrc file added , some build issues, then removed \_.babelrc

# Mobile Version

- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width
- https://v1.tailwindcss.com/docs/top-right-bottom-left#class-reference
- remove the header links and default to Menu bar only
- amm trading panel could look better on mobile iphone (make container smaller)
- dashboard text too wide : use same css as marketplace page

# Perps

working chart with historical data and ws: but renders two charts in `yarn dev` and only 1 chart in `prod` => good

- - - build function that gets the symbol - ethusdt ; substract "usdt" and toUpperCase
- - - get logo by ^^ Symbol ETH , BTC , etc automatically
