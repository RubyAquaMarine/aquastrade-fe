# bug

- m1 on homepage: resort back to daily tf for home page

lets token-gate : nft bronze or higher for perps-trading page: if no pass, redirect to nft page: investors for liquidity on perps are still allowed. ^^ trading pass

- test nft-gating on token-Airdrop page : targeting memecoin launchers basically : to prevent floods. (todo: deploy:token-Deployer-Factory)
