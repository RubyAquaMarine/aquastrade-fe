# ideas

- need a snap shot of all nft holders in 3 files : POST [{},{},{}] to api : then fetch list into airdrop ui
- - [input collection size ] /[ aqua amount]= [ airdrop per nft] :: fetch nft owners db
- - for $aqua quarterly airdrops in 3 clicks. (make is public then anyone can airdrop: to Aqua nft holders too)
